          Kamusta! I'm <span class="highlight">Zeus Miguel Orilla</span>, a tech
          enthusiast with a hint of shyness. My journey into the world of coding
          and design began not too long ago, sparked by a fascination for
          technology and the desire to create digital wonders.

            Like a curious explorer, I embarked on my coding adventure earlier
            this year. Armed with determination and a keyboard, I delved into
            Scrimba, learning the art of web development. The virtual world
            unfolded before me, and I couldn't resist diving into HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            My coding journey feels a lot like learning to play my favorite
            tunes on the guitarâ€”challenging but oh-so-rewarding. With each
            project I've crafted, from basic HTML to dynamic ReactJS apps, I've
            found a rhythm that keeps me going.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            The elegant dance of TailwindCSS and the power of ReactJS have
            become my companions on this journey. Every line of code I write is
            an expression of my passion and eagerness to contribute positively
            to the tech universe.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me-text">
            I'm not just seeking a front-end career; I'm yearning for a canvas
            to paint my digital dreams. I want to meld creativity with
            technology, to craft interfaces that make users smile and simplify
            their lives.
